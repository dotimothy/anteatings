Welcome to Peter's Anteating!
The goal is simple, eat all the ants
before they kill you....

The game utilizes HTML, CSS, JS to create
a web app with various sound effects in 3 different game modes:
-Easy
-Medium
-Hard

each level increasing the amount of ants, spawn rate
while decreasing the amount of total lives.

Beware! Game can cause cringe in users.
